# A purely functional approach to building large applications

This talk was given at Lambda Days in February 2015 and Scala Days in June 2015.

To run the presentation, open a `console` inside `sbt`.

Run the following line:

```
val rp = REPLesent(input="scaladays.txt", intp=$intp); import rp._
```

Then open the first slide by typing `f`.

The next slide, or portion of the slide by typing `n`. Go back with `p`.

Run the code with `!!` or `r`.
